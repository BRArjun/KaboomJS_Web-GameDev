This is the file that contains notes for my portfolio web development project.

This portfolio site is built in the form of an interactive 2D Game.

We are using HTML and CSS for the interactive elements of the page and Kaboom.js for the Game-specific
part of the implementation.

We are bootstrapping the project with Vite which is a bundler for web apps.

The Vite bundler works by transpiling the javascript that we write into a form of javascript that can
be rendered by the browser.
The bundler also does optimizations on the JS code so that it takes the least amount of space.

In the vite.config.js file we specify the base directory of our project so that hosting services can
find the root directory and then run files relative to it.

We use the "terser" and not the default es-build for minification because of a bug in the Kaboom js implementation

Generally it is more performance intensive when we draw the spritesheet tile by tile so in Kaboom we
use a normal tile editor for creating the level and export it as an image directly and hence we 'bake'
the tiles already.

The anims parameter is responsible for the animations that the user sprite does.
We specify the various animations that we want and we create the corresponding sprites for them.
Then we specify the sprite number ranges for the animations which in turn will loop through these
individual sprites and render the animation.
The speed parameter tells the fps that the animation is done in.
